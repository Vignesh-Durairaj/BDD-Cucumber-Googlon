# JBehave Exercise
A sample program to test the **Behavioral Driven Development (BDD)** using **Cucumber** framework, employing **Java 8** programming language.

 1. Started with a `feature` file, where the real time testing scenarios are written in `Gherkin` language
 2. The `feature` file has the test case in human readable format
 3. This explains the behavior of the application, rather than being a technical test case
 4. A Googlon challenge was used as a scenario to develop the solution using Cucumber (and BDD)
 5. Solution was arrived such that the `feature` file test cases are getting passed
 6. Test run will be triggered from `Runner` classes via `Step Definitions`
 7. Refer the `resources/Requirement_Specification.pdf` to understand the requirements.
